# Handwritten-Text-Recognition
The project focus on building a model to recognize the handwritten text which is fed as an image to the model.
The dataset used is the most popular handwritten dataset available online which is IAM dataset for words.
It consists of plenty of handwritten words from different authors.
CRNN and AlexNet models have been built. CTC loss function is used for both the models.
Accuracy obtained for CRNN on test samples is 73.44% and on AlexNet is 34.37%
